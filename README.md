## Customer Churn Prediction



## 📌 Problem Definition
The dataset, referred to as the Customer Churn table, encompasses data on all 7,043 customers associated with a Telecommunications company in California during Q2 2022.

Each entry corresponds to a unique customer and provides insights into their demographics, location, length of engagement, subscription services, and status for the quarter (indicating whether they joined, remained, or churned), among other details.

The accompanying Zip Code Population table furnishes supplementary information, offering estimates of populations for California zip codes mentioned in the Customer Churn table.

Our objective is to build a predictive model capable of determining whether a customer is likely to churn, remain, or join the company based on the parameters present in the dataset.

## 👉 Application

Anticipating churn in advance empowers businesses to implement proactive measures aimed at retaining existing customers. For instance, customer success teams can proactively engage with high-risk customers, offering support and assessing any unmet needs.

Calculating a company's churn rate offers a valuable insight into its customer retention performance. It serves as an indicator of the effectiveness and quality of the services provided by the business, reflecting on its overall utility to customers.
